Why have you used the selected implementation over others?

The current implementation fulfils the specifications outlined in the criteria sent by TechOne. While it is possible to implement additional features such as reading numbers from a file and returning each on a new line, the specification dictates “A simple console program to allow the routine to be tested interactively”. 

Implementation of additional features would be counterproductive if they were deemed unnecessary. It is possible to expand on the current implementation given additional requirements and as such this submission illustrates the functionality as clearly as possible without over-interpreting the requirements set by the client.
